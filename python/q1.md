## Question 1

You are given an array of integers. You want to transform it so that every element is **distinct**.

You may apply the following operation any number of times (including zero):

- Choose a subarray `arr[l..r]`.
- Within this subarray, keep only the **first occurrence** of each element, remove all duplicates, and preserve the order of the remaining elements.
- The **cost** of this operation is the number of **unique elements** in the chosen subarray.

Find the **minimum total cost** needed to make the entire array contain only distinct elements.

## Example 1

**Input:**  
`arr = [3, 2, 3, 2]`

**Output:**  
`2`

Here, the underlined subarray is selected for the subsequent operation.

Some possible sequences of operations are:

- `[_3_, _2_, _3_, 2] → [3, _2_, _2_] → [3, 2]`  
  Total cost: `2 + 1 = 3`

- `[_3  , _2_, _3_, _2_] → [3, 2]`  
  Total cost: `2`

- `[3, _2_, _3,_ _2_] → [_3_, _2_, _3_] → [3, 2]`  
  Total cost: `2 + 2 = 4`

---

## Example 2

**Input:**  
`arr = [2, 7, 4, 7]`

**Output:**  
`2`

Some possible sequences are:

- `[_2_, _7_, _4_, _7_] → [2, 7, 4]`  
  Total cost: `3`

- `[2, _7_, _4_, _7_] → [2, 7, 4]`  
  Total cost: `2`

---

## Constraints

- `1 ≤ length of arr ≤ 2 × 10^5`
- `1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^9`
